This is a data analysis project conducted using Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data and gain insights into the patterns and factors that contribute to booking cancellations.
<br>

##  Data

The dataset contains information about various features, including customer demographics, booking details, and reservation status. It has 119390 observations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.

The data was analyzed using a variety of methods, including descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing. **Descriptive statistics** were used to summarize the data and identify key trends. **Hypothesis testing** was used to test the relationship between different variables, such as the price of the room, days in waiting list and the cancellation rate.

* The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the hotel booking dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. 

* Next, data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This involves handling missing values, converting data types of features, and handling redundancy. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are then employed to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables. Seaborn and Matplotlib are utilized to create visualizations to highlight relevant patterns and trends.

* The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to booking cancellations. Statistical measures and visualizations are used to compare cancellation rates across different variables, such as booking month, waiting time, and booking channel. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the reasons behind cancellations and help hotels optimize their booking processes.

* Throughout the project, Python's pandas library is used to manipulate and analyze the data, while Seaborn and Matplotlib aid in creating meaningful visualizations to present the findings effectively. The project concludes with a summary of the key insights obtained from the analysis, providing actionable recommendations for hotel management to reduce cancellation rates and enhance the overall booking experience.

## Conclusion

* The results of this project can be used to help hotels reduce the number of cancellations. Hotels can use the information from the analysis to identify the factors that are most likely to lead to cancellations and to develop strategies to address these factors.
